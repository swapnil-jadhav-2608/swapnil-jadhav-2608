# 👋 Hi, I'm Swapnil  

I'm a **Node.js developer** passionate about building real-world automation, AI-powered tools, and scalable web applications.  
I enjoy solving problems with **JavaScript**, exploring **Data Structures & Algorithms**, and experimenting with **LLMs (like Phi & LLaMA)** for contextual reasoning tasks.  

### 🚀 What I Do
- 🕷️ Build **web crawlers & scrapers** (Puppeteer, Axios, Cheerio) for data collection.  
- 🤖 Integrate **AI/LLMs** into workflows for data analysis & decision-making.  
- 🌐 Work with **Next.js, MongoDB, MySQL** to create full-stack applications.  
- 📊 Automate **data pipelines** (CSV, JSON, Google Sheets integrations).  

### 📚 Currently Exploring
- Deep dive into **DSA in JavaScript**.  
- **Event-driven architecture** in Node.js.  
- Fine-tuning **LLMs (Phi-3, LLaMA, Scout 4)** for custom use cases.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`Node.js` · `JavaScript` · `Next.js` · `MongoDB` · `MySQL` · `Puppeteer` · `Axios` · `Cheerio`

💡 Always curious to learn, build, and share new things.  
🌱 Open to collaborations on **AI + automation projects**.
