# Hi, I'm Swapnil  

I'm a **Node.js developer** passionate about building automation, intelligent tools, and scalable web applications.  
I enjoy solving problems with **JavaScript**, exploring **Data Structures & Algorithms**, and experimenting with **LLMs (like Phi and LLaMA)** for contextual reasoning tasks.  

## What I Do
- Build **web crawlers and scrapers** (Puppeteer, Axios, Cheerio) to extract and organize information  
- Integrate **AI/LLMs** into workflows for smarter data analysis and decision-making  
- Develop **full-stack applications** with Next.js, MongoDB, and MySQL  
- Automate **data pipelines** (CSV, JSON, Google Sheets) for real-time workflows  

## Currently Exploring
- Strengthening problem-solving through **DSA in JavaScript**  
- Designing **event-driven systems** in Node.js  
- Fine-tuning **LLMs (Phi-3, LLaMA, Scout 4)** for custom AI use cases  

## Tech Stack
`Node.js` · `JavaScript` · `Next.js` · `MongoDB` · `MySQL` · `Puppeteer` · `Axios` · `Cheerio`

Always curious to learn, build, and share.  
Open to collaborations on **AI and automation projects**.
